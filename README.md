## API Automation Testing: Tests to verify Acceptance criteria for an API

## Instructions to run the tests: 

*   You need to have python installed to run the tests. To install python you can use "\APITestAssurity\Scripts\InstallPython.ps1" script. This script would download and install "python-3.7.3-amd64.exe". If you have organizational policies applied to your domain then this script may not get executed on your computer. In that case I recommend you to install python first.
*   Run Tests- you can run the tests by running "\APITestAssurity\Scripts\RunTests.ps1" script. Or you can run this directly as Python unit Test (Either by using IDEs like Eclipse,Pycharm or from command line).
